<h1>About Me</h1>
<p class="left-align">Currently I am an NDT technician looking to expand my skills and move into the world of development. I have always
  loved computers and enjoying learning what I can about coding as a full stack developer!
</p>

<p class="left-align">Currently I am working in my spare time to learn what I can about development, learning through various sources such as 
  Udemy, GitHub, tutorials online and many more.
</p>

<p class="left-align">I know this is only a very basic portfolio site currently, part of a project in a course on Udemy, but I will continue
  to update it as I learn more and progress as a developer. I would love any feedback or critiques about anything, my email 
  can be found on the contact me page!
